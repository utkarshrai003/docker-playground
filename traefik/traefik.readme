The main components of Traefik are -

- Providers - discover the services that live on your infrastructure (their IP, health, ...)
- Entrypoints - listen for incoming traffic (ports, ...)
- Routers - analyse the requests (host, path, headers, SSL, ...)
- Services - forward the request to your services (load balancing, ...)
- Middlewares - may update the request or make decisions based on the request (authentication, rate limiting, headers, ...)
